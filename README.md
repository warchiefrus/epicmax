## task-description

```
Develop a small app that shows a list of all JavaScript repos on Github, sorted by number of stars.

Requirements:
* List’s columns: name, url (link), owner, forks, open issues.
* Should have pagination on scroll
* Should show loader when data is being loaded.
* Should look nice and have some styling
* Please, store sources in a public repo (bitbucket, github, gitlab)
* Have a live version of an app deployed via netlify

Note:
* You can use GitHub API for that (https://api.github.com)
* Use Vue.js. Any flavor you’re comfortable with (ts, jsx, scss, scoped, bem, etc).
* You can use any other libraries (but no UI libries like Vuetify/Element/Material as we want to see custom styling).
* We expect you to do this at first attempt and spend no more than 4 hours.
